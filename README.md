# Number Guessing Game - Improved Version

This is my enhanced take on the classic **Number Guessing Game** in Python, originally inspired by [this GeeksforGeeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/number-guessing-game-in-python/).

---

## Overview

This project is a modular, user-friendly number guessing game with several improvements over the basic version, including:

- **Multiple difficulty levels** with predefined ranges (Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme) and a customizable mode
- **Dynamic attempts count** that can increase as you win more games consecutively (extra attempts awarded every 3 wins)
- **Helpful proximity clues** using intuitive emojis and colored feedback (`üî• Very close!`, `Warm`, `‚ùÑÔ∏è Cold`, etc.)
- **Motivational messages** to encourage the player after losses
- **Robust input handling** supporting case-insensitive difficulty selection, and numeric or textual input (e.g., "1" or "easy")
- **Statistical hints** when the player is far off, giving extra clues (divisible by 2, 3, or range hints)
- **Progress tracking** with win counts and streaks
- Modular code architecture with clear separation of game engine, player profile, and interface

## Code Files

* üî∏ **[`number_guessing_game_with_color.py`](./number_guessing_game_with_color.py)** ‚Äî The main game script with color output using `colorama` for a more engaging terminal experience.
* üîπ **[`number_guessing_game_no_color.py`](./number_guessing_game_no_color.py)** ‚Äî A plain version of the game without color ‚Äî ideal for basic terminal environments or systems without color support.



Both scripts contain the same game logic and modular design but differ only in their use of colored output.

## How to Use

Simply run either script in your Python environment. The game will guide you through:

1. **Choosing a difficulty level** (by name or number, case-insensitive)
2. **Guessing the target number** within a limited number of attempts
3. **Receiving feedback and hints** after each guess
4. **Tracking your wins and streaks** across sessions (in-memory per run)

The modular design lets you easily extend or integrate components, such as:

- Adding new difficulty levels or changing ranges
- Modifying motivational messages or clues
- Adjusting attempt counts or win conditions

## Inspiration & Original Idea

This project is a substantial update and improvement over the classic version found here:

[Python Number Guessing Game - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/number-guessing-game-in-python/)

I built upon the original by making the game more interactive, user-friendly, and visually engaging with colored feedback and a richer set of features.

Enjoy the game, and happy guessing!
