# ✊🖐✌ Rock-Paper-Scissors (with AI, Modes, and Menu)

This is an extended and interactive version of the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors game** in Python, heavily enhanced from the original [GeeksforGeeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-program-implement-rock-paper-scissor-game/).

## 🧠 Overview

This project turns a simple terminal game into a **feature-rich, menu-driven experience**. Designed for both casual players and developers exploring game logic or CLI interfaces, this version includes:

* 🎮 **Game Modes**: Play Best of 3, Best of 5, or Free Play (infinite rounds)
* 🧠 **AI Difficulty Levels**:

  * Easy → random
  * Hard → learns from your last move
  * Impossible → always counters your move
* 🎯 **Live Win Tracking**: Keeps score of wins, losses, and draws
* 🧾 **Real-Time Stats**: View your win ratio and performance after every round
* ⏸ **In-Game Menu (press `5` anytime)**:

  * Change difficulty or mode
  * Reset your score
  * Quit or continue
* 🧼 **Clean Prompts & UI**: Designed for smooth terminal interaction
* 🎉 **Dynamic Celebrations**: Fun messages when you win a round
* 🔁 **Replay Friendly**: Infinite play possible without restarting the script

## 🧱 Extension Ideas

This game was designed to be modular and expandable. Ideas for extending it:

* 🎮 Add multiplayer support (2-player local mode)
* 📊 Save scores/history to a file
* 🖼 Build a GUI (Tkinter or Pygame)
* 📡 Build an online version with sockets or Flask
* 🧠 Smarter AI using pattern recognition or ML

## 🧬 Inspiration & Origin

This project is an advanced, user-focused upgrade from the basic version shared here:

[Python Rock Paper Scissor Game – GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-program-implement-rock-paper-scissor-game/)

While the original demonstrates the core mechanics, this version expands it into a **fully interactive game**, complete with AI modes, menus, and performance tracking — perfect for learning and fun.
