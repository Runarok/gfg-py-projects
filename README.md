# gfg-py-projects

Rebuilt Python projects from GeeksforGeeks â€” clean code, clarity-first logic, no clutter.

This repo is a rebuild ground â€” each project is rewritten from scratch with focused logic and minimal dependencies. No copy-paste. No frameworks unless essential. Just raw Python builds with personal polish.

> Built for skill sharpening, not production. Clear, concise, and documented for reuse.
