Some projects are shared across multiple beginner articles. In those cases, I’ve only built the project once — in the folder where it made the most sense — and simply linked to it from the others to avoid duplicate code.

* [**countdown\_timer/**](../top-python-projects-gfg/countdown_timer/)
* [**number\_guessing\_game/**](../top-python-projects-gfg/number_guessing_game/)
