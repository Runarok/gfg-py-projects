# Word Guessing Game

This is my enhanced take on the classic **Word Guessing Game** in Python, originally inspired by [this GeeksforGeeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-program-for-word-guessing-game/).

## Overview

This project is a modular, terminal-friendly word guessing game with many improvements over the basic version, including:

- **Multiple difficulty levels** (Easy, Medium, Hard) and a **Custom mode** to let players define their own rules (word length, attempts, hints)
- **Rich word categories** including Animals, Technology, Nature, and more â€” selected randomly or by user choice
- **Letter-by-letter guessing** with visual word reveal and real-time feedback
- **Full-word guessing option** that allows a single high-risk, high-reward attempt
- **Hint system** that can reveal random letters or show the category name (with limited uses)
- **Input validation** to reject repeats, non-alphabetical input, and blank entries
- **Session tracking** including wins, losses, and average attempts
- **Timer per game** for added challenge or self-improvement tracking
- **Replay system** with game summary after each round
- Clean, readable structure with clear function separations for gameplay, input handling, and stats

## Code File

* ðŸŸ¢ **[`word_guessing_game.py`](./word_guessing_game.py)** â€” A pure Python version designed for maximum compatibility across terminals and browser-based compilers. No external dependencies required.

## How to Use

Run the script using any Python 3 interpreter. Once launched, the game will walk you through the following:

1. **Select a difficulty level** (Easy, Medium, Hard, or Custom)
2. **Choose or be assigned a word category**
3. **Start guessing letters or the full word** within your allowed attempts
4. **Use limited hints** to reveal letters or the category if you're stuck
5. **Win or lose**, then decide whether to play another round
6. **Track your performance** with real-time stats and time taken

The game emphasizes clarity and interaction while remaining lightweight and extensible. Ideal for both learners and tinkerers.

## Inspiration & Original Idea

This project is a substantial expansion of the original word guessing game available here:

[Python Word Guessing Game - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-program-for-word-guessing-game/)

I built upon that foundation to make the game smarter, deeper, and more replayable â€” with category selection, structured difficulty, a hint system, and session-aware design.

Enjoy playing â€” and may your guesses be sharp!
