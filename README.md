# 🛠️ gfg-py-projects

**Slightly better Python projects — rebuilt from GeeksforGeeks sources.**

This repo is a rework space: beginner projects from popular tutorials, rewritten with cleaner structure, sharper logic, and no noise.

> The original versions were built for beginners — but the bar has been raised.
> With AI tools everywhere, even beginner code deserves to be better.

No frameworks. No overkill. Just small, focused rewrites that respect the original intent — but clean it up for today’s standards.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Projects are grouped by their source article.
Each source has its own folder. Inside, each project has its own directory with code and a minimal README.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Most beginner project articles offer fast solutions — often too fast.
They get the job done, but they feel incomplete, dull, or outdated.

This repo is about revisiting those same small projects and giving them:

* A touch of structure
* Cleaner logic
* A little more pride in the code

Still beginner-friendly — just less copy-paste, more care.
