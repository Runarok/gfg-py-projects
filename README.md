# üõ†Ô∏è gfg-py-projects

**Slightly better Python projects ‚Äî rebuilt from GeeksforGeeks sources.**

This repo is a rework space: beginner projects from popular tutorials, rewritten with cleaner structure, sharper logic, and no noise.

> The original versions were built for beginners ‚Äî but the bar has been raised.
> With AI tools everywhere, even beginner code deserves to be better.

No frameworks. No overkill. Just small, focused rewrites that respect the original intent ‚Äî but clean it up for today‚Äôs standards.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

Projects are grouped by their source article.
Each source has its own folder. Inside, each project has its own directory with code and a minimal README.

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ top-python-projects-gfg/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-2/

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-a/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-b/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Each project contains:

* A cleaned-up Python script
* A small README with notes or examples if needed

## üß† Why This Exists

Most beginner project articles offer fast solutions ‚Äî often too fast.
They get the job done, but they feel incomplete, dull, or outdated.

This repo is about revisiting those same small projects and giving them:

* A touch of structure
* Cleaner logic
* A little more pride in the code

Still beginner-friendly ‚Äî just less copy-paste, more care.
